I didn't meet Estelle at a bar, a restaurant, at work or through a friend. I didn't meet Estelle on the Internet. I met Estelle in a mud pit 8,000 miles from home.

The mud in this pit was a mixture of gravel and clay. As volunteers, Estelle and I excavated it by the handful and turned into adobe bricks. We were two of around thirty international volunteers staying at the Mindfulness Project in the Issan region of Thailand.

It was July of 2015.

Estelle arrived two weeks after Skip and I, my backpacking trip companion. It was Skip who chose Thailand and Skip who chose the Mindfulness Project.

The first thing I noticed about Estelle was that she spoke fast. The second thing I noticed was that she spoke her mind. Her uninhibited style stuck out in project's more laid-back, passive atmosphere. Estelle made me laugh just being herself. Her style got my attention, and one day I sat down next to her during an iced coffee break.

I'd been reading a book called *Lila*, which is the sequel to the famous American novel *Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance*. Anybody can love *ZMM* because it has a cool title and a plot about motorcycle riding. *Lila*, however, has no motorcycles, a poor title, and a sketchy plot. Lila's metaphysics though are quite good and for an hour I tried to explain the combined metaphysics of these two books to Estelle. It was a risk.

Maybe the iced coffee was particularly strong (or cold) that day.

Estelle listened and was ahead of me with every sentence I spoke. She educated me about the connections between the "metaphysics" I was describing and the celebrated conclusions of the great philosophers and metaphysicians that she had studied in detail while obtaining one or more of her PHDs. I shrank to the size of a mosquito. What I had feared was now certain - Estelle was way too smart for me.
