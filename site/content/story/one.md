Estelle and I met at the Mindfulness Project in Thailand in July of 2015. Volunteers from all over the world come to the project to learn about yoga, meditation, Buddhism and permaculture.

This is our first known picture together, in a group of 5 volunteers stomping around in a mud pit to create adobe bricks.
