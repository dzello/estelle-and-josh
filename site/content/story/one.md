I didn't meet Estelle at a bar, a restaurant, at work or through a friend. I didn't meet Estelle on the Internet. I met Estelle in a mud pit. A mud pit 8,000 miles from home.

The mud in this mud pit was a mixture of gravel and clay. As volunteers, Estelle and I were excavating it by the handful so that it could be used to make adobe bricks. We were two of around thirty international volunteers staying at the Mindfulness Project in the northern Issan region of Thailand.

It was July of 2015.

Estelle arrived at the Mindfulness Project two weeks after Skip and I did. Skip was my backpacking trip companion, or more accurately I was his. It was Skip's idea to go to Thailand that summer and Skip who registered us for the Mindfulness Project. Thank you for that, Skip.

The first thing I noticed about Estelle was that she spoke fast and she spoke her mind. Her style stuck out in the more bohemian, commune-like atmosphere of the MP. She made me laugh, just by being honest. Her style got my attention, and one day I sat down next to her during one of the volunteers' illustrious iced coffee breaks. Thailand is hot, in case you weren't sure. Ice, let alone iced coffee, is a treat.

The next thing that I did would have gotten me ignored forever by anyone else. I got metaphysical. I'd been reading a book called Lila, which is the sequel to the famous Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. Anybody can love ZMM because it has a cool title and lots of motorcycle riding - the hundred or so "extra" pages of metaphysics can be skipped, no one is going to yell at you. Lila has no motorcycles, a poor title, and a sketchy plot but the metaphysics are really good. Our coffee break lasted around an hour, and that's about how much time I chose to spend attempting to explain the combined metaphysics of these two books.

This was a gamble. Maybe the iced coffee was particularly strong (or cold) that day. A few things happened. Estelle didn't leave. Instead, she educated me about the connections between the "pop metaphysics" I was describing and the cornucopia of great philosophers and metaphysicians that she had studied in detail while obtaining one or more of her PHDs. I shrank to the size of a mosquito. What I had suspected from several previous conversations was now a certainty - Estelle was way too smart for me.
