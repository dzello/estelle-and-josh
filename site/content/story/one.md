I didn't meet Estelle at a bar, a restaurant, at work or through a friend. I didn't meet Estelle on the Internet. I met Estelle in a mud pit 8,000 miles from home.

The mud in this pit was a mixture of gravel and clay. As volunteers, Estelle and I were excavating it by the handful to turn into adobe bricks. We were two of around thirty international volunteers staying at a place called the Mindfulness Project, located in the northern Issan region of Thailand.

It was July of 2015.

Skip and I arrived in early July and Estelle arrived two weeks later. Skip was my backpacking trip companion and it was he who chose Thailand, and the Mindfulness Project.

The first thing I noticed that Estelle she spoke fast. The second thing I noticed was that she spoke her mind. Her uninhibited, matter-of-fact style stuck out in projects more laid-back, passive atmosphere. She constantly made me laugh just being herself. Her style got my attention, and one day I sat down next to her during an iced coffee breaks. Thailand is hot and iced coffee is a treat.

I'd been reading a book called Lila, which is the sequel to the famous Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. Anybody can love ZMM because it has a cool title and a plot of motorcycle riding - the hundred or so "extra" pages of metaphysics can be skimmed over without missing a beat. Lila, however, has no motorcycles, a poor title, and a sketchy plot. Lila's metaphysics though are quite good. For one hour I decided to try to explain the combined metaphysics of these two books to Estelle.

This was a gamble. Maybe the iced coffee was particularly strong (or cold) that day. Estelle listened and didn't leave. She stayed to educate me about the connections between the "metaphysics" I was describing and the celebrated conclusions of the great philosophers and metaphysicians that she had studied in detail as she obtained one or more of her PHDs. I shrank to the size of a mosquito. What I had feared was now certain - Estelle was way too smart for me.
