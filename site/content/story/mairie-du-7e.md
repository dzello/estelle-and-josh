**Josh**: On September 30, 2017, Estelle and I were married by the mayor of the 7th arrondissement of Paris. It was a small, civil ceremony with a few of our closest family and friends. My father Frank and sister KatySue flew over from the US.

After the ceremony we walked to Chez Françoise for lunch. Jean-Luc, the father of the bride, treated us to a delicious lunch of herring, pistachio mousse and champagne. Estelle's mother Maud graced us throughout the day with her kind energy and smile.

After lunch we walked to the Champ de Mars to play pétanque and mölkky in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower. Celebrations continued until later in the evening at L'Eclair. My mother Carol was dearly missed, but she did receive a very merry phone call from us that evening.

I felt so happy to be surrounded by the love of family, friends and my... wife! That word took a little getting used to :)
