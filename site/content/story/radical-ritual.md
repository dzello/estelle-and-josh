**Josh:** The 2017 art theme for Burning Man was *Radical Ritual*. The stars aligned with dates and getting tickets, and we experienced the Burning Man ritual together for the first time.

We also co-created a ritual called *The Whine House*, which was a wine bar... with a twist. To get some wine we first needed to hear you whine about something, and the menu of whine-able things changed every night. The reward for getting something off of your chest was a piece of cheese and a nice glass of red or white, as cool and non-dusty as we could serve it.

Our camp was Juicy Rootz. They were all lovely, especially James and Ali, who shined like diamonds.
