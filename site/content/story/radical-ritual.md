**Josh:** Burning Man's 2017 art theme was *Radical Ritual*. It was my 6th turn at this ritual and one that will always be incredibly special â€” it was Estelle's first. We got tickets during the *OMG sale*, did *OMG preparation*, then had an *OMG experience*.

For seven consecutive days Estelle and I performed a ritual that we called *The Whine House*. We opened a three-bottle pop-up wine bar with one twist - you had to **whine** before you got any **wine**. The things you could whine about changed every night and included topics like *worst animal bite*, *obnoxious in-law* or *a broken heart*. The more gut-wrenching the whine, the longer the pour. Plus we had cheese and crackers.

Our camp was Juicy Rootz. They were all lovely, especially James and Alli, who shined bright like diamonds.
