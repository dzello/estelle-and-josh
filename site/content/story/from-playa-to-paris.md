**Josh:** I got back from Paris with three days to prepare for Burning Man, a yearly celebration that takes place in the high Nevada desert (also known as 'the playa'). Burning Man is a great place to do some thinking, and I was thinking a lot about Estelle. I knew I wanted to see her again but I didn't have a plan.

All week I reflected on the summer, and one afternoon I wrote the loving kindness meditation I learned at the Mindfulness Project on the walls of the temple. The next morning I randomly encountered a camp called Caf√© Surprise, fine operators of the Boulangerie de Black Rock. I took it as a sign - the next boulangerie I would eat at would have to be in Paris with Estelle. I found a camp with (very limited) Internet access and booked a one-way trip to France. I sent a short message to Estelle to let her know then I had to sign off.

On the way home from Burning Man, when cell phone service was restored, I called Estelle at our first stop for gas. I hadn't spoken to hear since Thailand and it was wonderful to hear her voice. Thankfully, she approved of my spontaneous airline itinerary.
