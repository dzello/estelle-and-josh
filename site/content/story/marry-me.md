**Josh:** On New Year's Day 2017, I decided that I would ask Estelle to marry me. She was scheduled to come to San Francisco in February, so I had about one month to prepare.

I bought a ring, booked an AirBnb, and after Estelle arrived the following month the two of us set off down the coast to Monterey. The state park I had planned to propose in was closed, but Estelle found another park called Jack's Peak. After a 3-hour hike to the top of a mountain, my heart in my throat the whole way, we sat down side-by-side on a bench.

Mid-sentence of a very normal conversation, I grabbed the ring box out of my left pocket, swung it around, opened it and asked "Will you marry me?" It was more abrupt than I had pictured in my head, to say the least. Estelle was silent for a few moments, and then said "Yes". I can't tell you how happy that made me.
