**Josh:** On New Year's Day of 2017, I decided that I would ask Estelle to marry me. She was scheduled to come to San Francisco in February, so I had about one month to prepare.

I bought a ring and booked an AirBnb close to the ocean in Monterey. Once Estelle arrived in California, the two of us set off down the coast. The state park I had planned to propose in was closed because of mudslides, but Estelle found another park nearby called Jack's Peak. After a 3-hour hike to the top of a mountain, my heart in my throat the whole way, we sat down side-by-side on a bench.

Mid-sentence of a typical conversation, I took the ring box out of my left pocket, swung it around so she could see it, opened it, and blurted out "Will you marry me?" It was more abrupt than I had pictured in my head, to say the least. Estelle was silent for several, very long moments, and then she said "Yes". I can't tell you how happy that made me.
