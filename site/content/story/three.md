After the Mindfulness project, Estelle went to an island called Koh Tao. I joined her there several days later after recovering from a serious illness.

We spent 6 days together on Koh Tao, and that's where we really got to know each other. During the day she'd ride behind me on our rented scooter to remote beaches on the island, and at night we'd watch dancers spin fire on the beach.
