At night, Estelle would go for a jog through the forest, so she could listen to her podcasts. These podcasts had clever names and their hosts had British accents. I found this peculiar, concerning, and brave. But I also understood.

There was no privacy at the Mindfulness Project. Thirty volunteers slept in two large rooms, one person per see-thru mosquito net. Going for a run at night was the only way to get alone time. No sooner did Estelle finishing explaining this to me than she was off, disappearing between two tall trees.

There were moments when I wasn't sure that Estelle was real. Moments that I wondered if I had dreamed her up, if she was a character in a story I had read in my sleep. I hadn't met someone like her before. She was a puzzle.

One day I asked Estelle to have dinner with me. This was a risk. The proposed date was on Buddha Day, a day where we would meditate for 6 to 8 hours at the Wat Pho Nan Tan Monastery, and be quite tired at the end. She said yes to dinner in a very manner-of-fact way, as if to say "most people do eat dinner, don't they?"".

At the time, I didn't know what the connection between Estelle and I was. The chance that it was a romantic connection seemed small. Still, dinner with 2 people would be a nice change compared to 30, and I knew that Estelle made me laugh, so why not?

We shared a bottle of wine and a handful of tapas. I felt like our rapport shifted from academic to personal. We talked about why we had come to the Mindfulness Project in the first place, and about the traumatic years we had just experienced.
