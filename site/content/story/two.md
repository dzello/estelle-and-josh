Khon Kaen is the nearest major city to the Mindfulness Project. Once a week, all of the volunteers would visit the city and spend the day meditating at a monastery.

In the evening there was some free time, and Estelle and I would go for a jog around the lake together, stopping for the occasional photo-op with the dinosaur statues lining the path.
