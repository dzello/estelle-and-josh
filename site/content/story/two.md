At night, Estelle would go for a jog through the forest so she could listen to her podcasts. These podcasts had clever names and hosts with British accents. I found this peculiar, concerning, and brave.

But I also understood. There was no privacy at the Mindfulness Project. There were thirty volunteers who slept in two large rooms, with one person per see-thru mosquito net. Going for a run at night was a smart way to get alone time. Each night Estelle would take advantage of this. Before I knew it, she'd have disappeared into trees.

There were moments when I wasn't sure that Estelle was real. Moments that I wondered if I had dreamed her up. I hadn't met someone like her before. She was a puzzle.

One day I asked Estelle to have dinner with me. This was a risk. The proposed date was on Buddha Day, a day where we would meditate for 6 to 8 hours at the Wat Pho Nan Tan Monastery, and be quite tired at the end. She said yes to dinner in a very manner-of-fact way, as if to say "most people do eat dinner, don't they?".

At the time, I didn't know what the connection between Estelle and I was. The chance that it was a romantic connection seemed small. Still, dinner with 2 people would be a nice change compared to 30, and I knew that Estelle made me laugh, so why not?

We shared a bottle of wine and a handful of tapas. I felt like our rapport shifted from academic to personal. We talked about why we had come to the Mindfulness Project in the first place, and about the traumatic years we had just experienced.
