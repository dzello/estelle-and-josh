At night, Estelle would go for a jog through the uncharted Thai forest so that she could listen to podcasts with clever names and hosts with British accents. I found this peculiar, concerning, and brave. I asked her why and she told me. There was no privacy at the Mindfulness Project - 30 volunteers slept in two large rooms, one person per see-through mosquito net - so going for a run at night was the only way to get some alone time. No sooner did she finishing explaining this to me than she was off, getting smaller and smaller until finally disappearing into the dark space between two distant trees.

There were moments when I wasn't sure that Estelle was real. Moments that made me wonder if I had dreamed her up, if she was a character in a story I had thought up before falling asleep. I had never met someone like her before. She was a puzzle.

One day I took a risk. I asked Estelle to have dinner with me the next time that the Mindfulness Project volunteers would be in Khon-Kaen, the nearest city. This happened once a week on Buddha Day, a day where we would medidate for 6 to 8 hours at the Wat Pho Nan Tan Monastery. She said yes, in a very manner-of-fact way, as if saying "most people eat dinner every day". At that time, I had no idea what the connection between Estelle and I was, and the chance that it could be a romantic connection beyond just an intellectual one seemed remote. Still, dinner with 2 people would be a nice change compared to 30, and I knew that Estelle made me laugh, so why not?

We shared a bottle of wine and a steady stream of tapas and I felt like our rapport was getting less academic and more personal. We talked about why we had come to the Mindfulness Project in the first place, and that we had both had relatively traumatic years up until that point.
