**Josh**: Estelle and I met in Thailand in the summer of 2015 while volunteering in Thailand at a place called the Mindfulness Project. People from all over the world come to the project to learn about yoga, meditation, Buddhism and permaculture.

One of our first encounters found us creating mud bricks together. Long stretches of manual labor, called *karma yoga*, gave volunteers the opportunity to talk to each other for hours at a time. It was through these conversations that Estelle and I first got to know each other. We also joined each other for iced coffee breaks in the nearby village.

We'll forever be grateful to the Mindfulness Project and its wonderful creator Christian, without whom we would never have met.
