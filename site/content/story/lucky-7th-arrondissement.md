**Josh**: On September 30, 2017, Estelle and I were married by the mayor of the 7th arrondissement of Paris. It was a civil ceremony with a few of our closest family and friends. My father Frank and sister KatySue had arrived from San Francisco days earlier.

After the ceremony we walked to Chez Françoise for lunch. Jean-Luc, the father of the bride, treated us to a delicious lunch of herring, pistachio mousse and champagne. Estelle's mother Maud graced us throughout with her kind energy and smile. For hours we ate, celebrated, and waited until the sun had parted the clouds before strolling a few blocks west to the Champ de Mars.

In the shade of the trees beneath the Eiffel Tower, we played pétanque and mölkky in rotating co-ed teams. We went for cocktails and planche at L'Eclair to quench our thirsts after the fierce competition. My mother Carol was not able to join us in person, but she did receive a very merry phone call from us after dinner, or just past noon for her.

Estelle's the one with the PhD in words, but me... I just don't have the words for how much love and luckiness I felt that day.
