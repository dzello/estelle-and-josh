**Josh**: On September 30, 2017, Estelle and I were married by the mayor of the 7th arrondissement of Paris. It was a civil ceremony with a few of our closest family and friends. My father Frank and sister KatySue had arrived from San Francisco days earlier.

After the ceremony we walked to Chez Françoise for lunch. Jean-Luc, the father of the bride, treated us to a delicious lunch of herring, pistachio mousse and champagne. Estelle's mother Maud graced us with her energy and smile. For hours we ate, celebrated, and waited until the sun had fully parted the clouds before sauntering over to the Champ de Mars.

In the shade of the trees that live in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower, we played pétanque and mölkky in rotating teams of two. To rest our bodies after this roaring competition, we went for cocktails and planche at L'Eclair. Though my mother, Carol, was not able to join us in Paris, she did receive a rather merry phone call from us at 8pm, of course just noon her time.

Estelle's the one with the PhD in words, but me... I just don't have the words for how much love and luckiness I felt that day.
