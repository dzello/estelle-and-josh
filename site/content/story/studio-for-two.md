**Estelle**: Before leaving, Josh told me he would come to Paris but had to go back to the US to go to a thing called Burning Man, which I’d never heard about before that summer, but which seemed to be a bit of a thing. A volunteer at the project had described it as “un festival de hippies qui font n’importe quoi dans le désert.”

As we had no internet connection there, the only image this conjured up was the epic eight-minute long dusty lovemaking scene in Antonioni’s film [Zabriskie Point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zabriskie_Point_(film)). So I confess did not really expect him to turn up on my doorstep three weeks later.

When he did, we had to make a few adjustments. Accommodating 2 people in a sixth-floor, 190-square feet Parisian garret is a bit of a make-or-break test. It turned out we must really have liked each other because we’ve managed to make it work ever since :) On Josh's first stay in Paris, we spent lots of time walking around the city and going to museums together.
