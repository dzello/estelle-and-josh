# Don't be "Attire Fire"

Feel free to dress more casually than for Saturday if you'd like. The weather might be hot.

This day starts earlier and goes longer. Please prioritize your comfort.

The ceremony will be officiated by our dear friend <br> **Julian Nachtigal**.

<br>

The ceremony will take place on land, not that it matters to Julian, who is equally capable of such feats at sea.

At 4pm, we will invite locals from the region to raise a glass with us, as goes the tradition, at La ferme du Grand Couvent.

Around 6pm, we will board a bus headed to the castle where we will eat, drink and dance.

A return bus will operate from 11pm onward.
