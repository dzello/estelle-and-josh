**Hello invitees for a very special day - July 28, 2018!**
We're thrilled so many of you are coming to join us in July ðŸŽ‰

Here's some information about what's going to happen during this weekend. This should help you book your travel and plan your stay in France. On to the Q&A!

<hr>

**What year are you getting married in?**
This year. 2018. In less than 6 months. But you knew that, right? Good. This was a warm-up question just to make sure you're paying attention.

**Wait, aren't you already married?**
Technically, in France, yes. We had a [small civil ceremony](/story/mairie-du-7e/) last September 30 at the town hall of the 7th arrondissement of Paris. That got the paperwork started so we can eventually live on the same continent (wouldn't that be nice!)

**Where and when should I plan to arrive in France?**
We recommend arriving in Paris no later than Thursday, July 26. A few days earlier is even better if you want to get ahead of that jet lag (recommended!).

**What will happen on the day of Saturday, July 28?**
Starting at 4:30pm on Sunday, we will gather you AND even more friends and family in the center of Paris and have a fine evening of celebration, food, drinks, and dancing. You will receive a separate invitation for this event with the full schedule.

**What is the dress code?**
Semiformal. We want you to be comfortable!

**Where should I stay in Paris?**
We don't have a hotel to recommend yet, but many of you might prefer to stay in an AirBnb to get a more local experience (recommended!). You will find good rates and availability since most Parisians leave Paris in the summer to go traveling. Paris will be all yours! When you make the booking, you should do it starting Friday July 27 through at least Sunday July 29. The wedding is just 1 block from Notre Dame on the ÃŽle de la CitÃ©, which is right in the middle of Paris (on an island, that's what ÃŽle means!) No matter where you stay, you'll be able to get to the wedding ceremony in no time.

**How long should I stay in Paris / Europe?**
Forever! Well actually that would just get you in trouble with the border police. For the Americans, 90 days is the longest you can stay on your short term visa (that includes France and most of continental Europe). By the way, you don't need to do anything to get that visa, it's automatic on your arrival. The only paperwork you need to travel with is your passport. We figure that most guests coming from the states will spend about 2 weeks in Europe, and we are happy to provide (individualized!) recommendations for how to get the best out of that time, whether you fancy Italy or London or even (why not!) Slovenia.
