**Hello invitees for a very special day - July 28, 2018!**
Here's some information about what's going to happen during this weekend. This should help you book your travel and plan your stay in France. On to the Q&A!

<hr>

**What year are you getting married in?**
This year. 2018. In less than 6 months. But you knew that, right? Good. This was a warm-up question just to make sure you're paying attention.

**Wait, aren't you already married?**
Technically, in France, yes. We had a [small civil ceremony](/story/mairie-du-7e/) last September 30 at the town hall of the 7th arrondissement of Paris. That got the paperwork started so we can eventually live on the same continent (wouldn't that be nice!)

*Signing our livret de famille - very official!*

**Where and when should I plan to arrive in France?**
We recommend arriving in Paris no later than Thursday, July 26. A few days earlier is even better if you want to get ahead of that jet lag (recommended!).

**What will happen on the day of Saturday, July 28?**
Starting at 4:30pm on Saturday, we will gather our friends and family in the center of Paris for a cheerful evening of celebration, food, drinks, and (of course!) dancing. You can see the full schedule at the end of this FAQ.

**What is the dress code?**
Summer semiformal (is that a thing?). We want you to be comfortable! Button-downs, suits and blazers won't be out of place, nor will dresses, skirts and pantsuits.

**Where should I stay in Paris?**
We don't have a hotel to recommend yet, but many of you might prefer to stay in an AirBnb to get a more local experience (recommended!). You will find good rates and availability since most Parisians leave Paris in the summer to go traveling. Paris will be all yours! When you make the booking, you should do it no later than Friday July 27 through at least Sunday July 29. The wedding is just 1 block from Notre Dame on the Île de la Cité, which is right in the middle of Paris (on an island, that's what Île means!) No matter where you stay, you'll be able to get to the wedding ceremony in no time.
