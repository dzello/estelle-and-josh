Hello! Our (next) marriage celebration will take place on Thursday, July 26. We do hope you can join us, and feel extremely flattered you'd consider coming so far!

I've gotten a few questions about how it's all going to down and I know that optimal travel booking time is coming up, so wanted to get a quick note out to everyone. In addition to this, you will be receiving a paper invitation to your mailboxes soon with more details.

**What year are you getting married in?**
This year. 2018. In less than 6 months. But you knew that, right? This was a warm-up question just to make sure you're paying attention.

**Wait, aren't you already married?**
Technically, in France, yes. We had a small civil ceremony last September 30 at the town hall of the 7th arrondissement of Paris. The reason is to get paperwork started so we can eventually live on the same continent (wouldn't that be nice!)


Signing our livret de famille - so official looking!

How many ceremonies are you having next July?
Two (2). One in Rocamadour, France (in the beautiful French countryside) on July 26 and one in Paris on July 28. Both are happening in incredible venues (we're quite lucky there) but have different constraints. For the Thursday reception + dinner in Rocamadour, we can accommodate about 80 people total. For that reason, it's a shorter guest list (and you're on it!). In Paris we can go up to 150 people and can accommodate even more of our friends and family.

Doesn't two ceremonies mean twice as much planning and don't both of you loathe planning?
Yes, it does! Yes, we do! Thank you for the kind reminder! :-*

Where and when should I plan to arrive in France?
We recommend arriving in Paris no later than Tuesday, July 24. A few days earlier is even better if you want to get ahead of that jet lag (recommended!). Arriving the previous Saturday or Sunday would, therefore, be perfect (parfait!). On Wednesday, July 25 you will take a transportation that we will prepare from Paris to Rocamadour. It's about a 4-5 hour trip that will start in the morning.

Where do I stay when I'm in Rocamadour?
This is taken care of for you. You will stay Wednesday and Thursday night in a convent that is like a thousand years old (but very clean and no ghosts!) You don't have to do anything to book your room, but if you do have any special needs as far as accommodations go please be sure to let us know. On Friday (not too early!), we will have transportation for you back to Paris.


This is Rocamadour. It’s a vertical city and (also!) a UNESCO World Heritage Site


This is the building where you will stay! (Couvent de Gramat)


This is the château where you’ll be feasting! (Château d’Aynac)

Where do I stay in Paris?
We don't have a hotel to recommend yet, but many of you might prefer to stay in an AirBnb to get a more local experience (do it!). You will find good rates and availability since most Parisians leave Paris in the summer to go traveling. Paris will be all yours! When you make the booking, you should do it starting Friday July 27 through (at least) Sunday July 29. The wedding is just 1 block from Notre Dame on the Île de la Cité, which is right in the middle of Paris (on an island, that's what Île means!) No matter where you stay, you'll be able to get to the wedding ceremony in no time.


This is the wedding venue in Paris on 12 rue Chanoinesse!

How long should I stay in Paris / Europe?
Forever! Well actually that would just get you in trouble with the border police. For the Americans, 90 days is the longest you can stay on your short term visa (that includes France and most of continental Europe). By the way, you don't need to do anything to get that visa, it's automatic on your arrival. The only paperwork you need to travel with is your passport. We figure that most guests coming from the states will spend about 2 weeks in Europe, and are happy to provide (individualized!) recommendations for how to get the best out of that time, whether you fancy Italy or London or even (why not!) Slovenia.
