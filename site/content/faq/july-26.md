**Hello invitees for two very special days - July 26 and July 28, 2018!**
We're thrilled so many of you are coming to join us in July ðŸŽ‰

Here's some information about what's going to happen this summer. This should help you book your travel and start planning your stay in France. You will also receive a paper invitation in the mail soon with more details, please keep an eye out for that. But for now, on to the Q&A!

<hr>

**What year are you getting married in?**
This year. 2018. In less than 6 months. But you knew that, right? Good. This was a warm-up question just to make sure you're paying attention.

**Wait, aren't you already married?**
Technically, in France, yes. We had a [small civil ceremony](/story/mairie-du-7e/) last September 30 at the town hall of the 7th arrondissement of Paris. That got the paperwork started so we can eventually live on the same continent (wouldn't that be nice!)

*Signing our livret de famille - very official!*

**How many ceremonies are you having next July?**
Two (2). One in Rocamadour, France (in the beautiful French countryside) on July 26 and one in Paris on July 28. Both are happening in incredible venues (we're quite lucky there) but have different constraints. For the Thursday reception + dinner in Rocamadour, we can accommodate about 80 people total. For that reason, it's a shorter guest list (and you're on it!). In Paris we can go up to 150 people and can accommodate much more of our friends and family.

**Doesn't two ceremonies mean twice as much planning and don't both of you hate planning?**
Yes, it does! Yes, we do! Thank you for the reminder! :-*

**Where and when should I plan to arrive in France?**
We recommend arriving in Paris no later than Tuesday, July 24. A few days earlier is even better if you want to get ahead of that jet lag (recommended!). Arriving the previous Saturday or Sunday would, therefore, be perfect ("parfait" in French!). On Wednesday, July 25 you will take transportation that we will prepare from Paris to Rocamadour. It's about a 4-5 hour trip that will start in the morning.

**What will happen on the day of Thursday, July 26?**
Starting in the early afternoon, we will begin the festivities with a French tradition, the vin d'honneur (the wine of honor). A ceremony will follow, and then we'll continue with dinner and dancing in a castle, the [ChÃ¢teau dâ€™Aynac](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C3%A2teau_d%27Aynac). A very special thank you to the father of the bride, Jean-Luc Murail, for arranging this incredible day!

**Where do I stay when I'm in Rocamadour?**
You will stay Wednesday and Thursday night in a grand, historical convent called the [Couvent de Gramat](http://www.grandcouventgramat.fr/en/home). The reservation will be taken care of for you and your guest. If you do have any special needs as far as accommodations go please be sure to let us know. On Friday (not too early!), we will have transportation for you back to Paris.

**What will happen on the day of Sunday, July 28?**
Starting at 4:30pm on Sunday, we will gather you AND even more friends and family in the center of Paris and have a fine evening of celebration, food, drinks, and dancing. You will receive a separate invitation for this event with the full schedule.

**Where do I stay in Paris?**
We don't have a hotel to recommend yet, but many of you might prefer to stay in an AirBnb to get a more local experience (recommended!). You will find good rates and availability since most Parisians leave Paris in the summer to go traveling. Paris will be all yours! When you make the booking, you should do it starting Friday July 27 through at least Sunday July 29. The wedding is just 1 block from Notre Dame on the ÃŽle de la CitÃ©, which is right in the middle of Paris (on an island, that's what ÃŽle means!) No matter where you stay, you'll be able to get to the wedding ceremony in no time.

**How long should I stay in Paris / Europe?**
Forever! Well actually that would just get you in trouble with the border police. For the Americans, 90 days is the longest you can stay on your short term visa (that includes France and most of continental Europe). By the way, you don't need to do anything to get that visa, it's automatic on your arrival. The only paperwork you need to travel with is your passport. We figure that most guests coming from the states will spend about 2 weeks in Europe, and we are happy to provide (individualized!) recommendations for how to get the best out of that time, whether you fancy Italy or London or even (why not!) Slovenia.

**What should I do if I have any more questions?**
Send an email to Estelle or Josh, we'll be happy to help!
