**Hello invitees for two very special days - July 26 and July 28, 2018!**
Here's some information about what's going to happen this week. This should help you book your travel and start planning your stay in France. On to the Q&A!

<hr>

**What year are you getting married in?**
This year. 2018. In less than 6 months. But you knew that, right? Good. This was a warm-up question just to make sure you're paying attention.

**Wait, aren't you already married?**
Technically, in France, yes. We had a [small civil ceremony](/story/mairie-du-7e/) last September 30 at the town hall of the 7th arrondissement of Paris. That got the paperwork started so we can eventually live on the same continent (wouldn't that be nice!)

*Signing our livret de famille - very official!*

**How many ceremonies are you having next July?**
Two (2). One ceremony on July 26 in the [Rocamadour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocamadour) region of France, famous for its vertical city (and cheese!) and another ceremony on July 28 in Paris. Both are happening in incredible venues (we're quite lucky there) but are different in nature. For the Thursday reception + dinner in Aynac, we can accommodate about 80 people total. For that reason, it's a shorter guest list (and you're on it!). In Paris we can have 150 people and accommodate even more of our friends and family.

**Doesn't two ceremonies mean twice as much planning and don't both of you hate planning?**
Yes, it does! Yes, we do! Thank you for the reminder! :-*

**Where and when should I plan to arrive in France?**
We recommend arriving in Paris no later than Tuesday, July 24. A few days earlier is even better if you want to get ahead of that jet lag (recommended!). Arriving the previous Saturday or Sunday would, therefore, be perfect ("parfait" in French!).

**How do I get from Paris to Gramat?**
On Wednesday, July 25 we will have a bus chartered that will take you from Paris to Gramat, where you will be staying. The bus will leave at 9am from a meeting point at the [Champs de Mars](https://goo.gl/maps/NZcSTbhhHQv). We'll make one stop for lunch and another 2 hour stop in Rocamadour where you can hike up and down the vertical city, or just have a drink in a properly medieval bar. We'll arrive at the Couvent de Gramat at 7pm, where you can check into your accommodations. Downtown Gramat is not far from the Couvent, and we will provide recommendations for where to eat that night while on the bus.

**Where do I stay when I'm in Gramat?**
You will stay Wednesday and Thursday night in a grand, converted convent called the [Couvent de Gramat](http://www.grandcouventgramat.fr/en/home). A reservation will already be made for you and your guest, including breakfast on both mornings. If you do have any special needs as far as accommodations go please be sure to let us know. On Friday at 1pm, we will all hop on a bus together back to Paris.

**Do I have to pay for the bus from Paris and the lodging in Gramat?**
We are asking for a donation of 100 EUR a person to cover the bus, 2 nights lodging, and 2 mornings breakfast. 100 EUR is about $115 USD. Please send Josh a Venmo or a Paypal to jdzielak+paypal@gmail.com.

**What will happen on the day of Thursday, July 26?**
Starting at 3pm in the afternoon, we will have a short ceremony followed by a French tradition, the Vin d'Honneur ("wine of honor") at the Couvent de Gramat. Then we'll continue with dinner and dancing in a castle, the [Château d’Aynac](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C3%A2teau_d%27Aynac). A very special thank you to the father of the bride, Jean-Luc Murail, for arranging this incredible day!

*This is the château where you’ll be feasting!*

**What is the dress code?**
Summer semiformal (is that a thing?). We want you to be comfortable! Button-downs, suits and blazers won't be out of place, nor will dresses, skirts and pantsuits.

**What will happen on the day of Friday, July 27?**
We take a bus from Gramat to Paris and arrive in Paris at 7pm. At 9pm, Estelle and Josh invite you to a reception at their apartment located at 143 Raspail Boulevard.

**What will happen on the day of Saturday, July 28?**
Starting at 4:30pm on Saturday, we will gather our friends and family in the center of Paris for a cheerful evening of celebration, food, drinks, and (of course!) dancing. You can see the full schedule at the end of this FAQ.

**Where should I stay in Paris?**
We don't have a hotel to recommend yet, but many of you might prefer to stay in an AirBnb to get a more local and likely cheaper experience. You will find good rates and availability since most Parisians leave Paris in the summer to go traveling. Paris will be all yours! When you make the booking, you should do it starting Friday July 27 through at least Sunday July 29. The wedding is just 1 block from Notre Dame on the Île de la Cité, which is right in the middle of Paris (on an island, that's what Île means!) No matter where you stay, you'll be able to get to the wedding ceremony in no time.
