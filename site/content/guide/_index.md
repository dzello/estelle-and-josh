# 🍽️

The dinner format is *cocktail dînatoire*. Servers will walk around with an assortment of cuisine and there will be two *culinary animations* where the chef prepares food as you watch. All courses from entrée to fromage to dessert will be served this way between 6-9pm. There will be tables and chairs to sit at while you eat, but you won't be assigned to a table.

You may want to pace yourself! 😛

To drink, we will be serving a selection of champagne, red and white wine throughout the evening. We'll also have beer from a local Paris craft brewer who will be on site to serve you and answer questions about the beer.

Dancing will begin around 9pm and continue until midnight. The music selection will include both American and French hits as well as some of our favorite electronic beats.

# Tips & Information

# #️⃣

# #EstelleAndJosh

Welcome to 2018, our wedding has a hashtag. Tag #EstelleAndJosh on photos and videos you share throughout the weekend.

---

# ⚠️

#### Please double-check that your passport is not expired.

---

# 🇫🇷

You can get by with English in Paris, but it won't hurt to brush up on a few [common French phrases](https://www.omniglot.com/language/phrases/french.php) for basics like please and thank you.

---

# 🚆

The Paris Metro is a fast and cheap way to get around. Trains run every 2-5 minutes—you don't need to plan trips in advance. Ticket machines work in English and are located at every stop. Google Maps will give you metro directions for any itinerary if you click on the public transportation tab.

---

# 📱

Many Paris cafés and restaurants have WiFi, but you can also get a [prepaid SIM card](https://www.lefrenchmobile.com/) very easily and have data everywhere. Should you need anything while in France, Josh's phone number is +33 07 67 94 85 19 or you can reach him via email or any messenger service.
