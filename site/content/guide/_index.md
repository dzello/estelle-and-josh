# 🍴 ️

The dinner format is *cocktail dînatoire*. Servers will walk around with an assortment of cuisine and there will be two *culinary animations* where the chef prepares food as you watch. Vegetarian and other restrictions will be clearly labeled. There will be tables and chairs to eat at but you won't be assigned to a table.

Advice: pace yourself! 😛

To drink, we will have a selection of French champagne, red and white wine, in addition to a non-alcoholic selection of soft drinks and juices. We'll also have beer from a local Paris craft brewer who will be on site to answer questions about the beer.

You can get by with English in Paris, but it won't hurt to brush up on a few [common French phrases](https://www.omniglot.com/language/phrases/french.php) for basics like please and thank you.

# 🚆

The Paris Metro is a fast and cheap way to get around. Trains run every 2-5 minutes—you don't need to plan trips in advance. Ticket machines work in English and are located at every stop.

Google Maps will give you metro directions for any itinerary if you click on the public transportation tab.

# 📱

Many Paris cafés and restaurants have WiFi, but you can also get a [prepaid SIM card](https://www.lefrenchmobile.com/) very easily and have data everywhere. Should you need anything while in France, here are our phone numbers:

- Josh: +33 07 67 94 85 19
