# Note

There are events all weekend, but you don't have to come to all (or any) of them. Except for the ceremony - you should come to that 😄

If you already have a jam-packed Paris itinerary, please don't feel the need to change anything!

# 🇫🇷

You can get by with English in Paris, but it won't hurt to brush up on a few [common French phrases](https://www.omniglot.com/language/phrases/french.php) for basics like please and thank you.

# 🚆

The [Paris Metro](https://www.ratp.fr/en/plans-lignes) is a fast and cheap way to get around. Trains run every 2-5 minutes—you don't need to plan trips in advance. Ticket machines work in English and are located at every stop.

Google Maps will give you metro directions for any itinerary if you click on the public transportation tab.

# 📱

Many Paris cafés and restaurants have WiFi, but you can also get a [prepaid SIM card](https://www.lefrenchmobile.com/) and have data everywhere. Should you need anything while in France, here are our phone numbers:

- Josh: +33 7 67 94 85 19
