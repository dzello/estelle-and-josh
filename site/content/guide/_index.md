# 🍴 ️

The dinner format is *cocktail dînatoire*. Servers will walk around with an assortment of cuisine  from 6-9pm and there'll be two *culinary animations* where the chef prepares food as you watch.

Advice: pace yourself! 😛

Vegetarian and other restrictions will be clearly labeled. You may sit down at any table you like to eat.

# 🍷🍺 ☕🍵

To drink we will have a selection of French champagne, red and white wine in addition to non-alcoholic soft drinks, juice, coffee and tea. We'll also have beer served by a local Paris craft brewer.

We'll also have water available for anyone who's dancing really hard.

Dancing will begin around 9pm and continue until midnight. The music selection will include both American and French hits as well as some of our favorite dance-friendly beats.

You can get by with English in Paris, but it won't hurt to brush up on a few [common French phrases](https://www.omniglot.com/language/phrases/french.php) for basics like please and thank you.

# 🚆

The [Paris Metro](https://www.ratp.fr/en/plans-lignes) is a fast and cheap way to get around. Trains run every 2-5 minutes—you don't need to plan trips in advance. Ticket machines work in English and are located at every stop.

Google Maps will give you metro directions for any itinerary if you click on the public transportation tab.

# 📱

Many Paris cafés and restaurants have WiFi, but you can also get a [prepaid SIM card](https://www.lefrenchmobile.com/) and have data everywhere. Should you need anything while in France, here are our phone numbers:

- Josh: +33 7 67 94 85 19
- Estelle: +33 6 15 29 03 27
