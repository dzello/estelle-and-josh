The ceremony will be officiated by the supernaturally creative <br> **Mark Fitzpatrick**.

# 🍴 ️

The dinner format is *cocktail dînatoire*. Servers will walk around with an assortment of cuisine  from 6-9pm and there'll be two *culinary animations* where the chef prepares food as you watch.

Advice: pace yourself! 😛

Vegetarian and other restrictions will be clearly labeled. You may sit down at any table you like to eat.

# 🍷🍺 ☕🍵

To drink we will have a selection of French champagne, red and white wine in addition to non-alcoholic soft drinks, juice, coffee and tea. We'll also have beer served by a local Paris craft brewer.

We'll also have water available for anyone who's dancing really hard.

# 👯

Dancing will begin around 9pm and continue until midnight. The music selection will include both American and French hits as well as some of our favorite dance-friendly beats.
